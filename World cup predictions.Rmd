#The objective 

The ovjective is given a match between to team be able to predict the goal difference between the two teams at the end of the match. We will try to predict the `outcome` target. Let's note that the `outcome` value can be zero (for draws), positive (whenever team1 wins) but also negative (whenever team2 wins the match).

#Upload data 

```{r}
matches_data <- read_csv("./matches.csv")
teams <- read_csv("./teams.csv")
head(matches)
```
Let's do some preprocessing cleaning of the train dataset. First we will remove duplicated data based on date, team 1, team 2. 
```{r}
matches <- matches_data %>% distinct(.keep_all=TRUE, date, team1, team2)
matches$date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(matches$date, "%Y%m%d"), origin="1960-01-01", tz="UTC")
matches$match_id = seq.int(nrow(matches))
head(matches)
summary(matches)
```
## Data exploration and Visualisation 
Matches played by year in each competition. Later we will keep only the official matches 
```{r}
matches %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(year(date))) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=CupName)) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "vertical") + ggtitle("Matches played by Year")
```

```{r}
matches %>% filter(CupName != "Friendly") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(year(date))) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=CupName)) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "vertical") + ggtitle("Matches played by Year without friendly game")
```

Let's plot the missing values in our dataset 
```{r}
Amelia::missmap(matches, main = "Missing values")
```
We switch the `team1`and `team2` because the `team1` had a lot of chance to win because it's the home team
```{r}
summary(matches$team1Score - matches$team2Score)
set.seed(4342)
matches$switch = runif(nrow(matches), min = 0, max = 1)

matches <- bind_rows(
  matches %>% dplyr::filter(switch < 0.5),
  matches %>% dplyr::filter(switch >= 0.5) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      x_team2 = team2,
      team2 = team1,
      team1 = x_team2,
      
      x_team2Text = team2Text,
      team2Text = team1Text,
      team1Text = x_team2Text,

      x_resText = "",
      
      x_team2Score = team2Score,
      team2Score = team1Score,
      team1Score = x_team2Score,
      
      x_team2PenScore = team2PenScore,
      team2PenScore = team1PenScore,
      team1PenScore = x_team2PenScore
    ) %>%
    dplyr::select(
      date, team1, team1Text, team2, team2Text, resText, statText, venue, IdCupSeason, CupName, team1Score, team2Score, team1PenScore, team2PenScore, match_id, switch
    )
    ) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(date) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(switch))
```
Let's add some additional features, We start by defining the venue if the first team or the second team or a neutrak venue. The second step is to define the cup name, we introduce logical variables to specify the cup name (Friendly, Qual, Final, Confederations Cup)
```{r}
matches$team1Home <- mapply(grepl, pattern = matches$team1Text, x=matches$venue, MoreArgs = list(fixed=TRUE, ignore.case= FALSE))
matches$team2Home <- mapply(grepl, pattern = matches$team2Text, x=matches$venue, MoreArgs = list(fixed=TRUE, ignore.case= FALSE))
matches$neutralVenue <- !(matches$team1Home | matches$team2Home)

# text-matching the venue is not 100% accurate.
# some games get TRUE for both team1 and team2 (ex. Congo DR vs Congo)
# in this case, team1 is at home
matches$team2Home[(matches$team1Home == TRUE) & (matches$team2Home == TRUE)] <- FALSE
# game type: Friendly, Qualifier, Final Tournament
matches$friendly <- FALSE
matches$friendly[matches$CupName == "Friendly"] <- TRUE

matches$qualifier <- FALSE
matches$qualifier[matches$CupName %like% "Qual"] <- TRUE

matches$finaltourn <- FALSE
matches$finaltourn[matches$CupName %like% "Final"] <- TRUE
matches$finaltourn[matches$CupName %like% "Confederations Cup"] <- TRUE
head(matches)
```

At this point, we're going to eliminate friendly matches from the dataset.This decision is based on the observation that, with few exceptions, the main objective for a team playing a friendly is not to win it, but to evaluate its own players and tactics.


```{r}
matches <- matches %>% dplyr::filter(friendly == FALSE)
```
Up until this point we've only looked at individual matches. However, what we really need is to look at each team's performance over its history.
Building this dataset is simple: take each observation in matches - which has the form "team1 vs team2" - and produce two separate observations of the form "team1 played against team2" and "team2 played against team1" respectively.
```{r}
# transform the matches table into a team performance table, where each team being 
# involved in a game is a separate observation (row)

teamperf <- bind_rows(
    (matches %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      name = team1,
      opponentName = team2,
      homeVenue = team1Home,
      neutralVenue = neutralVenue,
      gs = team1Score,
      ga = team2Score,
      gd = gs - ga,
      w = (team1Score > team2Score),
      l = (team1Score < team2Score),
      d = (team1Score == team2Score),
      friendly = friendly,
      qualifier = qualifier,
      finaltourn = finaltourn
    ) %>%
    dplyr::select (match_id, date, name, opponentName, homeVenue, neutralVenue, gs, ga, gd, w, l, d, friendly, qualifier, finaltourn))
    ,
    (matches %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      name = team2,
      opponentName = team1,
      homeVenue = team2Home,
      neutralVenue = neutralVenue,
      gs = team2Score,
      ga = team1Score,
      gd = gs - ga,
      w = (team1Score < team2Score),
      l = (team1Score > team2Score),
      d = (team1Score == team2Score),
      friendly = friendly,
      qualifier = qualifier,
      finaltourn = finaltourn
    ) %>%
      dplyr::select (match_id, date, name, opponentName, homeVenue, neutralVenue, gs, ga, gd, w, l, d, friendly, qualifier, finaltourn))
  ) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(date)

head(teamperf)
```

In order to capture some information about how good each team is, let's define a winning percentage formula:

`winpercentage = (wins + 0.5 * draws) / games played`

This formula is very similar to FIFA formula to calculate the national team ranking. 
Then, let's plot that for each team which has played a significant number of games.
```{r}
# Out of the teams who have played at least 100 games, what are the winning percentages for each of those teams?

formula_winpercentage <- function(totalgames, wins, draws) {
    return ((wins + 0.5 * draws) / totalgames)
}

plot_winpercentage <- function(teamperf, mingames) {
  teamperf %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(
    totalgames = n(),
    wins = length(w[w==TRUE]),
    draws = length(d[d==TRUE]),
    winpercentage = formula_winpercentage(totalgames, wins, draws)
  ) %>%
  filter(totalgames >= mingames ) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = winpercentage, y = totalgames)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=name), hjust=-.2 , vjust=-.2, size=3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .5, linetype = 2, color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Winning Percentage vs Games Played") +
  expand_limits(x = c(0,1))
} 

plot_winpercentage(teamperf, 100)
```

For one thing, some countries have ceased to exist, either because they dissolved into multiple countries - for example the Soviet Union (URS), Yugoslavia (YUG) or Czechoslovakia (TCH), or because they united into one country - like it was the case with the German reunification of 1990. In the latter case, West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) unified into a single Germany (GER). Here the most impacted country is Germany.


```{r}
# transform old country codes into new ones.
countryCodeMappings <- matrix(c(
  "FRG","GER",
  "TCH","CZE",
  "URS","RUS",
  "SCG","SRB",
  "ZAI","COD"
  ), ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)

for (i in 1:nrow(countryCodeMappings)) {
  teamperf$name[teamperf$name == countryCodeMappings[i,1]] <- countryCodeMappings[i,2]
  teamperf$opponentName[teamperf$opponentName == countryCodeMappings[i,1]] <- countryCodeMappings[i,2]
  
  matches$team1[matches$team1 == countryCodeMappings[i,1]] <- countryCodeMappings[i,2]
  matches$team2[matches$team2 == countryCodeMappings[i,1]] <- countryCodeMappings[i,2]
}
plot_winpercentage(teamperf, 100)
```
Let's plot the most commun score in our dataset and the most common score in the World Cup games.
```{r}
# what is the occurence frequency for match scores?

scorefreq <- matches %>% filter(grepl("FIFA World Cup",CupName)) %>%
  group_by(team1Score, team2Score) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    freq = n / nrow(matches)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    scoretext = paste(team1Score,"-",team2Score)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq)) 

  head(scorefreq, 20)

  scorefreq %>%   filter(freq >= 0.01) %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=scoretext, y=freq)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
# distribution of goals scored per match
gsfreq <- matches %>% filter(grepl("FIFA World Cup",CupName)) %>%
  group_by(gs = team1Score + team2Score) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    freq = n / nrow(matches)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(freq)) 

head(gsfreq, 10)

gsfreq %>%
  filter(freq >= 0.01) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = gs, y = freq)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ggtitle("Goals scored per match distribution")
```

```{r}
# distribution of goal differential
gdfreq <- matches %>% filter(grepl("FIFA World Cup",CupName)) %>%
  group_by(gd = team1Score - team2Score) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    freq = n / nrow(matches)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(gd) 

head(gdfreq %>% filter(abs(gd)<=4), 10)

gdfreq %>%
  filter(abs(gd)<=4) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = gd, y = freq)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ggtitle("Goal differential distribution")
```

## Strength of opposition
```{r}
# confederations and adjustment coefficients for them
confederations <- as.data.frame(matrix(c(
  "UEFA","0.99",
  "CONMEBOL","1.00",
  "CONCACAF","0.85",
  "AFC","0.85",
  "CAF","0.85",
  "OFC","0.85"
), ncol=2, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(NULL, c("confederation","adjust"))), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
confederations$confederation <- as.vector(confederations$confederation)
confederations$adjust <- as.numeric(confederations$adjust)

# add a confederation coefficient for the opponent faced 
teamperf <- teamperf %>%
  dplyr::left_join(teams, by=c("opponentName" = "fifa_code")) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(confederations, by=c("confederation")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    opponentConfederationCoefficient = adjust
  ) %>%
dplyr::select(match_id, date, name = name.x, opponentName, opponentConfederationCoefficient,  homeVenue, neutralVenue, gs, ga, gd, w, l, d, friendly, qualifier, finaltourn)

# set missing values to 1
teamperf$opponentConfederationCoefficient[is.na(teamperf$opponentConfederationCoefficient)] <- 1
```

## Feature engineering
Now, let's calculate some lag features for each team which is about to play a game.

We'll look at the previous N games a team has played, up to the game in question, and we'll calculate the percentage of wins, draws, losses, as well as the goal differential, per game, for those past N games.

For example, taking N=10:

`last10games_w_per = (number of wins in the past 10 games) / 10`
`last10games_d_per = (number of draws in the past 10 games) / 10`
`last10games_l_per = (number of losses in the past 10 games) / 10`
`last10games_gd_per = (goals scored - goals conceeded in the past 10 games) / 10`

We'll use three different values for N (10, 30 and 50) to capture short, medium, and long-term form.

We'll calculate those values for every team and every game in our dataset.


```{r}
# Let's calculate some lag features for each team which is about to play a game
# we'll take three windows: last 5 games, last 20 games, last 35 games.
# for each window we'll calculate some values

lagfn <- function(data, width) {
  return (rollapplyr(data, width = width + 1, FUN = sum, fill = NA, partial=TRUE) - data)
}

lagfn_per <- function(data, width) {
  return (lagfn(data, width) / width)
}

team_features <- teamperf %>%
  dplyr::arrange(name, date) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(name) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    last10games_w_per = lagfn_per(w, 10),
    last30games_w_per = lagfn_per(w, 30),
    last50games_w_per = lagfn_per(w, 50),

    last10games_l_per = lagfn_per(l, 10),
    last30games_l_per = lagfn_per(l, 30),
    last50games_l_per = lagfn_per(l, 50),

    last10games_d_per = lagfn_per(d, 10),
    last30games_d_per = lagfn_per(d, 30),
    last50games_d_per = lagfn_per(d, 50),
            
    last10games_gd_per = lagfn_per(gd, 10),
    last30games_gd_per = lagfn_per(gd, 30),
    last50games_gd_per = lagfn_per(gd, 50),
      
    last10games_opp_cc_per = lagfn_per(opponentConfederationCoefficient, 10),
    last30games_opp_cc_per = lagfn_per(opponentConfederationCoefficient, 30),
    last50games_opp_cc_per = lagfn_per(opponentConfederationCoefficient, 50)

  ) %>%
  dplyr::select (
    match_id, date, name, opponentName, gs, ga,
    w, last10games_w_per, last30games_w_per, last50games_w_per,
    l, last10games_l_per, last30games_l_per, last50games_l_per,
    d, last10games_d_per, last30games_d_per, last50games_d_per,
    gd, last10games_gd_per, last30games_gd_per, last50games_gd_per,
    opponentConfederationCoefficient, last10games_opp_cc_per, last30games_opp_cc_per, last50games_opp_cc_per

          ) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()

head((team_features %>% dplyr::filter(name == "BRA" & date >= '1970-01-01')), n = 20)
summary(team_features)
```

Now that we have built a series of team-specific features, we need to fold them back into match-specific features.

We will then have a set of features for both teams about to face each other.

```{r}
# fold per-team features into per-match features
match_features <- matches %>%
  left_join(team_features, by=c("match_id", "team1" = "name")) %>%
  left_join(team_features, by=c("match_id", "team2" = "name"), suffix=c(".t1",".t2")) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    date, match_id, team1, team2, team1Home, team2Home, neutralVenue, team1Score, team2Score, friendly, qualifier, finaltourn,
    last10games_w_per.t1,
    last30games_w_per.t1,
    last50games_w_per.t1,
    last10games_l_per.t1,
    last30games_l_per.t1,
    last50games_l_per.t1,
    last10games_d_per.t1,
    last30games_d_per.t1,
    last50games_d_per.t1,
    last10games_gd_per.t1, 
    last30games_gd_per.t1,
    last50games_gd_per.t1,
    last10games_opp_cc_per.t1, 
    last30games_opp_cc_per.t1, 
    last50games_opp_cc_per.t1,
    last10games_w_per.t2,
    last30games_w_per.t2,
    last50games_w_per.t2,
    last10games_l_per.t2,
    last30games_l_per.t2,
    last50games_l_per.t2,
    last10games_d_per.t2,
    last30games_d_per.t2,
    last50games_d_per.t2,
    last10games_gd_per.t2, 
    last30games_gd_per.t2,
    last50games_gd_per.t2,
    last10games_opp_cc_per.t2, 
    last30games_opp_cc_per.t2, 
    last50games_opp_cc_per.t2,
    outcome = gd.t1
  )

head(match_features)
names(match_features)
```

```{r}
# drop all non-interesting columns, and those which should not be supplied for new data (like scores)
match_features <- match_features %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(match_id,team1Score,team2Score))

head(match_features)
names(match_features)
```

```{r}
# correlation matrix
cormatrix <- cor(match_features %>% dplyr::select(-c(date, team1, team2, team1Home, team2Home, neutralVenue, friendly, qualifier, finaltourn)) )
corrplot(cormatrix, type = "upper", order = "original", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, tl.cex = 0.5)
```
## Training model
```{r}
# create the training formula 
trainformula <- as.formula(paste('outcome',
                                 paste(names(match_features %>% dplyr::select(-c(date,team1,team2,outcome))),collapse=' + '),
                                 sep=' ~ '))
trainformula
```

```{r}
# training and testing datasets

data.train1 <- match_features %>% dplyr::filter(date < '2009/1/1')
data.test1 <- match_features %>% dplyr::filter(date >= '2009/1/1' & date <= '2015/1/1')

nrow(data.train1)
nrow(data.test1)
```

```{r}
# train a random forest
model.randomForest1 <- randomForest::randomForest(trainformula, data = data.train1, 
                                                  importance = TRUE, ntree = 500)

model.randomForestFinal <- randomForest::randomForest(trainformula, data = rbind(data.train1,data.test1), 
                                                  importance = TRUE, ntree = 500)


summary(model.randomForest1)
```


## Model evaluation 
```{r}
randomForest::importance(model.randomForest1, type=1)
randomForest::varImpPlot(model.randomForest1, type=1)
```
We can now expose our trained model to the test dataset, and calculate indicators related to its accuracy.
```{r}
data.pred.randomForest1 <- predict(model.randomForest1, data.test1, predict.all = TRUE)

metrics.randomForest1.mae <- Metrics::mae(data.test1$outcome, data.pred.randomForest1$aggregate)
metrics.randomForest1.rmse <- Metrics::rmse(data.test1$outcome, data.pred.randomForest1$aggregate)

paste("Mean Absolute Error:", metrics.randomForest1.mae)
paste("Root Mean Square Error:",metrics.randomForest1.rmse)

abs_error <- abs(data.test1$outcome - data.pred.randomForest1$aggregate)
plot(abs_error, main="Mean Absolute Error")
```
## Simulating the tournament 
```{r}
qualified <- read_csv("wc2018qualified.csv")
```
We will generate all the the possible two-team combinations, then ask the model for predictions for each combination, and then store those predictions.We can store the mean values, as well as the standard deviation of the predicted values from every one of our decision trees. This will allow us to simulate a more realistic distribution of results, for multiple iterations of the same match.

```{r}
# get a list of possible matches to be played at the world cup

data.topredict <- expand.grid(team1 = qualified$name, team2 = qualified$name, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% filter(team1 < team2)

temp <- teamperf %>%
  semi_join(qualified, by = c("name")) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(
    date = max(date)
  )

temp <- team_features %>%
  semi_join(temp, by = c("name", "date"))

# calculate the features for every possbile match

data.topredict <- data.topredict %>%
  left_join(temp, by = c("team1" = "name")) %>%
  left_join(temp, by = c("team2" = "name"), suffix = c(".t1", ".t2")) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    team1, team2,
    last10games_w_per.t1,
    last30games_w_per.t1,
    last50games_w_per.t1,
    last10games_l_per.t1,
    last30games_l_per.t1,
    last50games_l_per.t1,
    last10games_d_per.t1,
    last30games_d_per.t1,
    last50games_d_per.t1,
    last10games_gd_per.t1, 
    last30games_gd_per.t1,
    last50games_gd_per.t1,
    last10games_opp_cc_per.t1, 
    last30games_opp_cc_per.t1, 
    last50games_opp_cc_per.t1,
    last10games_w_per.t2,
    last30games_w_per.t2,
    last50games_w_per.t2,
    last10games_l_per.t2,
    last30games_l_per.t2,
    last50games_l_per.t2,
    last10games_d_per.t2,
    last30games_d_per.t2,
    last50games_d_per.t2,
    last10games_gd_per.t2, 
    last30games_gd_per.t2,
    last50games_gd_per.t2,
    last10games_opp_cc_per.t2, 
    last30games_opp_cc_per.t2, 
    last50games_opp_cc_per.t2      
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.POSIXct("2018-06-14"), 
    team1Home = (team1 == "RUS"), team2Home = (team2 == "RUS"), neutralVenue = !(team1Home | team2Home), 
    friendly = FALSE, qualifier = FALSE, finaltourn = TRUE
  )

head(data.topredict)
```
```{r}
# ask the model to predict our world cup matches
data.predicted <- predict(model.randomForestFinal, data.topredict, predict.all = TRUE)
head(data.predicted)
```
So, for every game in our input dataset, we've got the individual predictions from every one of our 500 decision trees, as well as the mean value of those predictions.

We're going to save the mean values, as well as the standard deviation of the 500 individual predictions. The standard deviation is a measure of how "dispersed" our values are; in other words, how close (or far away from) the mean the individual values are.

```{r}
# calculate the standard deviation of the individual predictions of each match

data.predicted$sd = apply(data.predicted$individual, c(1), sd)

# keep only the interesting columns for running tournament simulations
data.staticpred <- data.topredict %>% 
  dplyr::select(team1, team2)

data.staticpred$outcome = data.predicted$aggregate
data.staticpred$sd = data.predicted$sd

head(data.staticpred)
```


We can use the mean and standard deviation values to pick an individual outcome for a match. For example, we can use the normal distribution in conjunction with R's rnorm function to pick an outcome for a match where we have obtained a predicted mean and standard deviation from the model.

For instance, let's assume we need to provide predicted outcomes for a Brazil vs Argentina match.

```{r}
teamA <- "GER"
teamB <- "FRA"
temp <- data.staticpred %>% dplyr::filter(team1 == teamA & team2 == teamB)
if(nrow(temp) == 0){
  tempTeam <- teamA
  teamA <- teamB 
  teamB <- tempTeam
  temp <- data.staticpred %>% dplyr::filter(team1 == teamA & team2 == teamB)
}
temp
```


```{r}
set.seed(4342)
draw_threshold <- 0.5575

temp2 <- rnorm(100, temp$outcome, temp$sd)
temp2

plot(round(temp2),xlab="Match Index",ylab="Goal Diff", main=paste(teamA,"vs",teamB, "100 simulated matches"))
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = "gray60")
abline(h = -0.4475, v = 0, col = "gray60", lty=3)
abline(h = +0.4475, v = 0, col = "gray60", lty=3)
mtext(c(teamB,"Draw",teamA),side=2,line=-3,at=c(-3,0,3),col= "red")

paste(teamA," won", length(temp2[temp2 > +draw_threshold]), "matches.")
paste(teamB," won", length(temp2[temp2 < -draw_threshold]), "matches.")
paste(length(temp2[temp2 >= -draw_threshold & temp2 <= +draw_threshold]), "matches drawn.")
```
```{r}
predict_win <- function(team1,team2,draw_threshold=0.4475) {
  teamA <- team1
  teamB <- team2
  temp <- data.staticpred %>% dplyr::filter(team1 == teamA & team2 == teamB)
  if(nrow(temp) == 0){
    tempTeam <- teamA
    teamA <- teamB 
    teamB <- tempTeam
    temp <- data.staticpred %>% dplyr::filter(team1 == teamA & team2 == teamB)
  }
  set.seed(4342)

  temp2 <- rnorm(100, temp$outcome, temp$sd)
  l <- list(teamA,teamB,length(temp2[temp2 < -draw_threshold]),length(temp2[temp2 > +draw_threshold]),length(temp2[temp2 >= -draw_threshold & temp2 <= +draw_threshold]))
  #print(paste(teamA," won", length(temp2[temp2 > +draw_threshold]), "matches."))
  #print(paste(teamB," won", length(temp2[temp2 < -draw_threshold]), "matches."))
  #print(paste(length(temp2[temp2 >= -draw_threshold & temp2 <= +draw_threshold]), "matches drawn."))
  return(l)
}
```

```{r}
equipe <- data.staticpred[,c("team1","team2")]
for(row in 1:nrow(equipe)){
  l <- predict_win(equipe[row,"team1"],equipe[row,"team2"])
  results[row,"teamA"] <-  l[1]
  results[row,"teamB"] <-  l[2]
  results[row,"teamA_win"] <- l[4]
  results[row,"teamB_win"] <- l[3]
  results[row,"draw"] <- l[5]
}
```

#Find a draw treshold 
In order to find a draw treshold we used the gris search method to find the treshold that maximize our performance, in our case the treshold that minimize the mean absolute error


```{r}
mae_vector <- c()
threshold_seq <- seq(from=0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
for(threshold in threshold_seq){
  temp_data <- as.vector(data.pred.randomForest1$aggregate)
  temp_data <- with(data.frame(x = temp_data), replace(x, temp_data >= -threshold & temp_data <= threshold, 0))
  metrics.randomForest1.mae <- Metrics::mae(data.test1$outcome, temp_data)
  mae_vector <- c(mae_vector,metrics.randomForest1.mae)
}

best_treshold_index <- which.min(mae_vector)
best_threshold <- threshold_seq[best_treshold_index]
sprintf("The best threshold is : %f",best_threshold)
```
```{r}
df <- data.frame(threshold = threshold_seq, mae = mae_vector)
p <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=threshold, y=mae)) + geom_point()
p
```
